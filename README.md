This is a fun Stock Price Prediction Using Python &amp; Machine Learning.

This is a fallow along that can be found  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUxPv5PJOY&t=464s 

In the video, the programmer did an analysis on AAPL. 

However, I've done the same analysis on United States Steel.

I would like to play with this code some more.

I would like the program to prompt the user with:
1) stock price
2) Start date
3) End date
4) number of epoachs 
5) and moving day average

I give full credit of this code to : Computer Science off Youtube.
Link is provided above.

Thank you,
